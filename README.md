# Build ITS from scratch

### About ITS

ITS, the Incompatible Timesharing System, is an operating system for
the PDP-10 computer family.  It was written by hackers at MIT in the
1960s.  The MIT site was shut down in 1990, but enthusiasts continue
to operate ITS systems to this day.

### Building it from scratch

This repository contains source code, tools, and scripts to build ITS
from scratch.

...or at least, that's the plan.  There will be some initial
experimentation in the [`test` branch](http://github.com/PDP-10/its/tree/test).
